# 🔄 Multi-Level Approval Process

## Overview

The SmartFinance system implements a **dynamic multi-level approval process** that automatically adapts based on the roles configured in each loan product. The system ensures that **the accountant is always the final approver** for disbursement.

## Approval Workflow Types

### 1. Single Level Approval (1 Role + Accountant)
```
Loan Officer → Accountant (Disbursement)
```
- **Configuration**: `approval_levels = "1"` (Role ID 1)
- **Flow**: Officer checks → Accountant disburses
- **Use Case**: Simple loans requiring minimal oversight

### 2. Two Level Approval (2 Roles + Accountant)
```
First Role → Second Role → Accountant (Disbursement)
```
- **Configuration**: `approval_levels = "1,2"` (Role IDs 1 and 2)
- **Flow**: First role checks → Second role approves → Accountant disburses
- **Use Case**: Medium-risk loans requiring additional review

### 3. Three Level Approval (3 Roles + Accountant)
```
First Role → Second Role → Third Role → Accountant (Disbursement)
```
- **Configuration**: `approval_levels = "1,2,3"` (Role IDs 1, 2, and 3)
- **Flow**: First role checks → Second role approves → Third role authorizes → Accountant disburses
- **Use Case**: High-risk loans requiring maximum oversight

## Dynamic Action Mapping

The system automatically determines the appropriate action for each approval level:

| Level | Action | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `check` | Initial review and verification |
| 2 | `approve` | Secondary approval |
| 3 | `authorize` | Final authorization |
| Last | `disburse` | Fund disbursement (Accountant only) |

## Configuration

### Loan Product Setup

1. **Enable Approval Levels**:
   ```php
   $product->has_approval_levels = true;
   ```

2. **Set Approval Roles**:
   ```php
   $product->approval_levels = "1,2,3"; // Comma-separated role IDs
   ```

3. **Role Assignment**:
   - Role ID 1: Loan Officer
   - Role ID 2: Supervisor
   - Role ID 3: Manager
   - Last Role: Accountant (automatic)

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Loan Products Table
ALTER TABLE loan_products ADD COLUMN has_approval_levels BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE loan_products ADD COLUMN approval_levels TEXT NULL;

-- Loan Approvals Table
CREATE TABLE loan_approvals (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    loan_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    role_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    approval_level INT NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    comments TEXT NULL,
    approved_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Loan Model Methods

```php
// Get approval roles from product configuration
public function getApprovalRoles()

// Get next approval level
public function getNextApprovalLevel()

// Get next approval role ID
public function getNextApprovalRole()

// Get next action (check/approve/authorize/disburse)
public function getNextApprovalAction()

// Check if user can approve
public function canBeApprovedByUser($user)

// Get role name for display
public function getApprovalLevelName($level)
```

### Controller Methods

```php
// Main approval method (handles all levels)
public function approveLoan($encodedId, Request $request)

// Rejection method
public function rejectLoan($encodedId, Request $request)

// Legacy compatibility methods
public function checkLoan($encodedId, Request $request)
public function authorizeLoan($encodedId, Request $request)
public function disburseLoan($encodedId, Request $request)
```

## User Interface

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Permissions**: Only users with the correct role can approve
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all approval actions
3. **Status Validation**: Prevents invalid state transitions
4. **Transaction Safety**: Database transactions ensure data integrity

## API Endpoints
